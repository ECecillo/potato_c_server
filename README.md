# Creating a TCP/IP web server from "scratch" using C ðŸ”¨.

# Why ?

This is a personnal project that aims to learn and understand how web server are built, see how TCP work ...

For this I chose to follow the following article which explain everything nicely 

https://medium.com/from-the-scratch/http-server-what-do-you-need-to-know-to-build-a-simple-http-server-from-scratch-d1ef8945e4fa

# HTTP

Explain and show how it work

# Transport Layer and TCP

same

# Socket

Communication Channels that enable unrelated processes to exchange data locally or/and across networks.
A single socket is one end point of a two-way communication channel.

## File descriptors
[Source](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/f/file-descriptor.htm)

Number that uniquely identifies an open file in a computer OS. It describes a data resource, and how that resource
may be accessed.

When a program asks to open a file â€” or another data resource, like a network socket â€” the kernel:

- Grants access.
- Creates an entry in the global file table.
- Provides the software with the location of that entry.
